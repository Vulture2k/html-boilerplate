                    <p class="text">After you've created a lead magnet, the next obstacle is finding individuals who are both interested in the topic you cover and in your unique perspective on it.</p>
                    <p class="text">That's where niche communities come into play. Digital spaces such as subreddits, Facebook groups, Discord channels, and Circle communities can all help you build momentum in the early stages.</p>
                    <p class="text">The strategy requires you to <strong>provide free value</strong> by answering people’s questions, generating ideas, and becoming a trusted voice in the group. Then, over time, you can naturally direct these interactions towards your
                        content and email list.

                        is believing they must be <em>everywhere</em> to reach new readers.</p>
                    <p class="text">The best strategy is to <strong>choose a single platform</strong> and double down on it. </p>
                    <p class="text"><em>Why is it more effective to be fewer places online?</em></p>
                    <p class="text">Because each network comes with its own unique practices, movements, and language. Mastering one is a tall order, but will enable you to build deeper connections and take advantage of platform-specific trends.</p>
                    <p class="text">Often, the niche communities you're a part of, as well as your audience, will have a preferred network. Meet them where they're at while pointing back to your website, newsletter, and lead magnet whenever appropriate.</p>
